As a Data Science minor as UC Berkeley, I conducted complex data analysis and applied industry-standard machine learning techniques to explore real-world data. 

During this project, I examined a predictive model developed by the Chicago Cook County Assessor’s Office (CCAO), used to estimate the values of houses in order to assign property taxes. Unjustly, the model for estimating house value perpetuated a highly regressive tax system that disproportionately taxed African-American and Latinx homeowners in Cook County. 

My task was to create a new model to predict the market value of homes using machine learning regression tools on the existing CCAO dataset. I conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection and statistical approaches to yield a reliable model with high accuracy on the train and test sets. I began with exploratory data analysis using visualisation techniques and correlation metrics to identify which variables required alternative statistical treatment. I then developed custom functions for individual features, constructing a feature engineering pipeline. Although this approach was more time-intensive and technically demanding, it yielded a high predictive accuracy on the test set. This experience reinforced the importance of interrogating my algorithms and centering social impact considerations when developing robust and equitable machine-learning algorithms.

(Note: I received an A grade on this project. There was a glitch in this assignemnt, but all test cases were passed)
